11. Our Policy Concerning Children
As used herein, the “child” or “children” means under the age of 13, and the term “parent” includes legal guardians.
Our Games and related Services are intended for general audience.  We do not knowingly collect, use or share any personally identifiable information about children without verifiable parental consent or as permitted by law.  If you are a parent and you believe your child has provided us with personal information, you can contact us and request your child’s information to be deleted from our system.
Once a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13, we will not collect any personal information from that user except certain limited information permitted by the law.  For example, we may ask for the name and online contact information of a child user’s parent in order to provide notice and obtain a parental consent.  In addition, we may collect certain information permitted by the law to support and protect the security, integrity and operation of our Services.
If a child states that his/her age is under 13, we will seek consent from the child’s parent before collecting personal information from the child; except we may collect and use certain information from the child for limited purposes without obtaining parental consent where permitted to do so by law. 
We generally do not offer children who identify themselves as being under 13 the chat functionality or services that enable them to publicly disclose personal information (such as online forum, messenger, or e-mail)(collectively, “Communication Services”).  However, if we offer such Communication Services as part of our Game or Services to children, we will restrict the child from accessing them until we receive a verifiable consent from the child’s parent.
Where a parent has provided consent, a child may be able use our Services much like any other user, including some services that enable the child to publicly disclose personal information or communicate with other users of all ages. Once we have a parent’s consent, we may collect from the child the same types of personal information, and use and share that information for the same purposes, as described in this Privacy Policy.  If we make any material changes in the way we process your child's personal information, we will notify parents by email or by in-game notice to obtain verifiable parental consent for the new uses of your child's personal information.
Parents can review the personal information we have collected from their child and request them to be deleted.  Parents can also revoke their previously provided consent to collection or use of the child’s information.  If you are a parent and wish to review, modify, or delete your child’s personal information, or withdraw consent, you can submit a request to our Privacy Administrator at the address, e-mail address or telephone number provided below.
